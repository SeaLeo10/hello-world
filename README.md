Hi. 
The sky is gray, as usual, in Hamburg. Drizzle. Cold. I'd say that's how you know it's Winter -- rain, clouds, no sun in sight -- but, the truth is, this could also be Summer or Spring or Fall. No snow yet, though. Luckily. 

What gets you through? Gl√ºhwein. Coffee. Tea. Baking cookies. And friends.
